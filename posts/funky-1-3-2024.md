# Clover Stadium - Part 2

Well, one month after the funky stadium analysis, I'd like to show you Clover Stadium.
Note: the screenshots contain coin pickups, but the video doesn't.

There's also a video showcasing some gameplay.

Now, from the video you can see that the kart controls weren't ready. This did make designing the level a bit more difficult.
After all, I couldn't really test how it 'felt' to play.

Remember that it's supposed to be a blockmesh, not a finished product. The only reason it does have texturing is because
I felt like doing that as well in this particular game jam. There was only a month of time.
I knew it would speed up the process if I could just sit down and do at least some texturing myself.

## Postmortem

So, what do I think about my own level after this month? Well, it's about what I would expect to see from a junior
level designer. There is definitely some charm to the overall design of it, but I feel like it lacks intentional design.
Some areas feel blank and open without much to experience, but other areas are interesting to look at and play.

Honestly had there been solid gameplay, it would've been easier to hone in on intentional, fun design. It's hard to tell
what feels good if the kart controls aren't quite there yet. Visually I think it looks alright and would still be fun
to play, even if the design wasn't honed in on the gameplay.

I learned a lot about Blender again from this project, mostly rotation snapping and working with curves and profiles.
Funky Stadium looked so easy, I thought 'I can do that'. Until you actually start modelling, then you realize just how
involved it all is.

I still think it's a solid project to show off, but I would see it as a 'junior' level. Hopefully
I get to grow and learn more about level design in the future. If you showed me a level, I could most likely point out
the intentional design behind it. However, putting together a level myself seems something different entirely. I know
the theory, but applying it in a way that looks and feels right, is difficult.

Anyway, that's it for Clover Stadium, I'm moving on to other projects.
