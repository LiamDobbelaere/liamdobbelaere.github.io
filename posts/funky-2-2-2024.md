# Level Design - Clover Stadium - Part 1

For the Minigame A Month game jam, someone reached out to me to create a stadium map for their kart game. They gave Funky
Stadium from Mario Kart Wii as an example. Their game mechanics weren't that established yet, but they did mention the
ability of being able to do tricks as well.

I'm trying to get more experience so I said yes. The first thing I did was look at Funky Stadium and try to understand
how it's put together. First, an annotated image:

The picture says it all, but here's a summary of the core elements with my opinions:

### Spacious and open, the player feels tiny

I honestly think Funky Stadium is scaled up a tad amount too much. For a battle arena, its spaciousness really doesn't
seem to encourage players meeting each other which is a shame.

### Bright lights on the walls, aimed inwards at the stadium

This essentially creates an effect akin to 'fullbright' levels, like if you forget to add lights in a Source map. You actually
get this effect in real life stadiums as well.

### Seats for crowds sitting at a higher level, pretty much all around the stadium

I was surprised about the multi-level crowds, especially how they used a balcony. It creates a nice contrasting effect and helps the space feel grander and bigger.

### The player starts outside the main area, a large slope helping the player jump into the arena

This works, just remember it's not a necessity. You can perfectly start inside the arena too.

### Some goodies are in circular spots with slowing terrain (like sand)

This seems like a basic way to give the player a risk-vs-reward situation.

### Humps to drive over, slopes, ramps that give you big air time

There are also collectibles in the air which creates a skill based reward.

### Ads all around the stadium

Makes it feel more like a genuine stadium, even in a cartoony setting like Funky Stadium.

### Huge landmark in the middle with a logo (not actually visible when driving, so not a 'real' landmark)

I was surprised to learn it wasn't an actual landmark. It didn't serve to help the player orient themselves, because you can't
actually see it when driving. I kept getting confused if I was on the top or lower half of the arena, because those
two parts looked very similar (but they were not identical). The landmark in the middle wouldn't have helped with
that. Maybe a landmark asymmetrically on one side of the arena would've been better?

### Speed pads on some ramps

The bright, glowing arrows are an affordance. The player learns to recognize this as a speed pad that will boost them.

With this, I know most elements that make up a kart stadium map. Of course there can be other obstacles, mechanics and
so on. But I'll leave that up to when I'm making the actual level.

## What's next?

Now that I've taken a look at Funky Stadium, I can get to building my own level. An early idea I sketched was a clover-like
design in a circular arena. Hopefully I'll have something to show soon.
