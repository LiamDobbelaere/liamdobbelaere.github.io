# Clover Stadium - Part 1

For the Minigame A Month game jam, someone reached out to me to create a stadium map for their kart game. They gave Funky
Stadium from Mario Kart Wii as an example. Their game mechanics weren't that established yet, but they did mention the
ability of being able to do tricks as well.

I'm trying to get more experience so I said yes. The first thing I did was look at Funky Stadium and try to understand
how it's put together. First, an annotated image:

<sub>The picture says it all, but I'll talk about each point regardless</sub>

**Funky Stadium is a very open space**. I felt tiny as a player while driving around. Each slope is about 7-8 kart-lengths wide. I honestly think it's all scaled up a tad amount too much. For a battle arena, you would think it's important that you bump into players sometimes.
Except its spaciousness doesn't seem to encourage anyone meeting another player which is a shame. I could be wrong though. I've never played this game nor do I have much experience with kart games, that was just how I felt.

There are **bright lights on the walls**, aimed inwards at the stadium. This essentially creates an effect akin to 'fullbright' levels, like if you forget to add lights in Hammer in a Source map. You get this effect in real life stadiums as well, just look up a photo of a football stadium. The entire arena is lit, shadows are almost non-existent at times.

**The crowd is sitting all around the arena**, at different heights. I was surprised about how they used a balcony. It creates a nice contrasting effect and helps the space feel grander and bigger.

The player **starts outside the main area**, a large slope helps them jump into the arena. This works, just remember it's not a necessity. You can perfectly start inside the arena too. It's a basic example of a valve that locks them into the space.

Some **goodies** are in **circular spots with slowing terrain** (like sand). This seems like a simple way to create a risk-vs-reward situation. They go in the sand, they slow down, but they can get the powerup. Cool.

There are humps to drive over, **slopes and ramps that give you air time**. Collectibles are floating in the air which creates a skill based reward. You have to aim your jump right to get the coins (if you're playing the Coin Runners mode).

**Ads are placed all around the stadium**. It's more of a visual thing, but it makes it feel more like a genuine stadium.

In the middle there's this **huge landmark with a logo**. It's not actually visible however when driving, so I wouldn't call it a real landmark. It didn't serve to help the player orient themselves, because you can't actually see it when driving. I kept getting confused if I was on the top or lower half of the arena, because those two parts looked very similar (but they were not identical). The landmark in the middle wouldn't have helped with that. Maybe a landmark asymmetrically on one side of the arena would've been better?

There are **speed pads on some ramps** (but not all). The bright, glowing arrows are an affordance. The player learns to recognize this as a speed pad that will boost them.

With this, I know most elements that make up a kart stadium map. Of course there can be other obstacles, mechanics and
so on. But I'll leave that up to when I'm making the actual level.

## What's next?

Now that I've taken a look at Funky Stadium, I can get to building my own level. An early idea I sketched was a clover-like
design in a circular arena. Hopefully I'll have something to show soon.
